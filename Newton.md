# Isaac Netwon's Theory of Gravity

Isaac Newton is sometimes said to be the discoverer of gravity. Gravity is the name for the force that causes objects to fall toward the Earth. Newton wrote about his "discovery" in a book he wrote in 1688. Of course, people knew that objects fall to the Earth long before 1688. We've known that since before there were books! 

So what was Newton the first to discover? Newton discovered that _all physical objects are attracted to one another_  _and_ he discovered the two factors that determine how powerful that attraction is. _Gravity_ was his name for that force of attraction.

## What determines Gravity?

First, gravity is affected by _amount of matter_, a quantity that we call _mass_. Every physical object has is made of matter and all matter has mass. Today, we know that quantity of matter is related to the number and size of atoms in an object. 

According to Newton, it takes a lot of matter to create gravitation. That's why you never notice the gravity between you and your table. But that's also why you _do_ notice the gravity between you and Earth: because the Earth is huge, it has a large gravitational effect.

So why don't you notice the gravity of the moon? It is really big too, but you don't feel pulled toward the moon!

The second thing that affects the force of gravity is _distance_. The farther you are from very massive things, the less their gravity affects you. You might think about it this way: the farther you get from something, the more it's gravity has "spread out" through all of space. When it's gravitaitonal force gets very spread out, it becomes very weak. 

## Gravity is all around us

However, Newton actually discovered that we do  experience the effect of the moon's gravity around us: he was the person who figured out that _the moon's gravity causes the tides!_ This was one of the major pieces of evidence that Newton had discovered an important truth; before that, no one had explained the tides. Another very important piece of evidence was that the Sun's gravity is what keeps planets in orbit around it. His theory was very mathematical and using it he showed that the known shapes and velocities of the planetary orbits could be derived from his law of gravity and his three laws of motion.

Newton's discovery was not really that objects fall to the Earth (that was already discovered). He discovered that the tendency of object to fall to the Earth is everywhere in our world and responsible for many of the things we see, both in space and on Earth.
