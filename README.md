# Humean

Named for Scottish Philosopher David Hume, who famously claimed that we have no idea of causation, this repo contains functions for causal inference.

Currently, this repository's main branch describes some goals, but the code is all underdevelopment. Everything is underdevelopment.

## Retro

Retro contains a simple retrospective causal inference model. A retrospective model can be applied to an existing data set to determine whether some of the variables in the data are causal. It works by identifying entities in a dataset that exhibit an effect condition, matching those to similar entities, and determining whether some features predict memebership in the experimental condition. See [retro.ipynb](https://github.com/philosofool/humean/blob/retro/retro.ipynb) for more discussion. For a simple explanation, see Ronald Giere, _Understanding Scientific Reasoning._

The work underdevelopment can be found on the branch [retro](http://github.com/philosofool/humean/tree/retro).
