#Humean

Named for Scottish Philosopher David Hume, who famously claimed that we have no idea of causation, this repo contains functions for causal inference.

Currently, you won't find anything in this repository's main branch. Everything is underdevelopment.

## Retro

Retro contains a simple retrospective causal inference model. A retrospective model can be applied to an existing data set to determine whether some of the variables in the data are causal. It works by identifying entities in a dataset that exhibit an effect condition, matching those to similar entities, and determining whether there is evidence of a difference in the match population. For a simple explanation, see Giere "Understanding Scientific Reasoning."
